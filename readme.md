NFL Playoff Wins Per Team Animated Bar Chart

This repo will contain Python code to generate an animated bar chart provided the NFL playoff wins per year per team. The resulting animation will (hopefully) illuminate team dynasties, droughts & resurgances since SuperBowl I.

Roadmap:
    Generate codebase to consume (mock) data, parse the data & present the data in an animated chart.
    Identify & validate the data used to create the animation.
    Insert team logos to improve the animation.

    Unresolved:
        How to deal with expansion/contraction
        How to deal with relocation
        How to deal with changes to the playoff format over the years

How to use this code:
TDB

Help:
While help is not required at this time, if you have suggestions to improve the code, increase flexibility, improve the statistics, etc. please feel free to contact the repo author or submit a pull request.
